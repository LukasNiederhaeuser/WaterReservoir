# WaterReservoir

SUMMARY
------------------------------

In the folder "data" you will find all the data which was needed for the report. The corresponding 
Jupyter Notebook file containing the analysis is named "EDA_Forecasting_Water_Reservoir_Levels".
Additionally you can find the links to the data sources in the "data" folder.


USAGE 
------------------------------

The analysis requires the user to have Jupyter Notebook installed on his / her computer. Another
option is to open the .ipynb file on Google Colab, where you can insert all the data and then refer
to the storage-folder, which is the recommended approach since the autohors created the report with
the use of Google Colab.

To run the analysis it is recommended to extract the data-folder and store all the data in a place 
of your choice. When using Google Colab you have to mount the folder, where you stored the data. 
In Jupyter Notebook, when loading the data you can refer to the folder where you stored the data to. 
With the Jupyter Notebook approach you have to adjust the code in order to let Python know to which 
folder you are referring to.
